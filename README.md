In this particular project we have cleaned the data that we have taken from Wikipedia. By using Python the data has been cleaned and the data has also been manipulated to best fit the results we need.
After which we have visualized the data in Tableau. We have created tableau map visualizations, tableau summary tables, tableau symbol maps, and then put it all together in a tableau dashboard.
